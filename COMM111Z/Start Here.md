3 main speeches:

	* Introducing a speaker
	* a commencement speech
* 3 Chunks, and at the end of every chunk there is a speech

How are speeches submitted:
* Recorded and posted on YouTube
* Then feedback is given

Will learn what your nervous habits are

Cannot redo a speech
* Once it is submitted and the deadline is past there is no do-over

What if I make a mistake?
* Some mistakes are glaringly obvious to the audience
* Some mistakes are only obvious to you, and the audience won't have a clue about that

Can I read or memorize your speech
* Yes, but for most people that really hurts there delivery
* Start making eye contact that is off of the camera
* Monotone voice, and run out of breath
* Certain delivery behaviors are obvious

Tips for the class:
* It is a 4 credit class, meaning there is 12-16 hours of work every week
* Make sure you set time apart, and look ahead at what you need to do
* Start speeches early to make sure that you get in the practice time
* You should use the viewing feedback and fixing technology module
	* If anything looks funky in the class go back to it first
* Don't get too hooked up on deliver
* **GIVE YOURSELF ENOUGH TIME TO PRACTICE**

* **Practice more than you realize:**
	* Do it more than 2-3 times, and make sure you can express yourself
	* Most good speakers need at least 10 times]
	* The way you practice matters:
		* Don't use too many notes
		* The more you practice the more you should look away from the notes
		* Cut down your notes into half every single time you practice
			* Will be down to bullet points by the end
		* When you are practices the last couple of times the keywords should help you
	* Don't say the same thing over and over again
		* Causes you to have to restart sentences if you can't remember it
	* Practice with as many ways as you can
	* Keep your practice sessions realistic
		* Look up away from your notes
		* Use the body language that you want to use
		* Some people use stuffed animals and use them as dummy people
	* Add distractions to make the speech easier to do in a conversational tone

Audiences prefer extemporaneous tone
* Break away from the "safety net of notes"
* Use it in professional settings
