# 6.1: General Purposes of Speaking

3 Types of Speeches
* Deliberative: A political speech
* Forensic: Courtroom speech

3 Purposes of Speeches:
1. Informative: To teach or provide with information
2. Entertain: To be engaging
3. Sway: a persuasive speech

**General Purpose**: The broad goal of the speech, What the speaker is trying to convey to their audience.
* Mistake: Blurring persuasive speeches into informative
* Don't try to convince your audience to do something

**Knowledge sharing**: is the process of delivering information, skills, or expertise in some form to people who could benefit from it.

**Pure Persuasion:** occurs when a speaker urges listeners to engage in a specific behavior or change a point of view because the speaker truly believes that the change is in the best interest of the  audience members

**Manipulative Persuasion:** on the other hand, occurs when a speaker urges listeners to engage in a specific behavior or change a point of view by misleading them, often to fulfill an ulterior motive beyond the face value of the persuasive attempt.

**Attitude:** is defined as an individual’s general predisposition toward something as being good or bad, right or wrong, negative or positive.

**Value:** refers to an individual’s perception of the usefulness, importance, or worth of something.

**Beliefs:** are propositions or positions that an individual holds as true or false without positive knowledge or proof.

**Core Beliefs** are beliefs that people have actively engaged in and created over the course of their lives (e.g., belief in a higher power, belief in extraterrestrial life forms). 

**Dispositional Beliefs:**, on the other hand, are beliefs that people have not actively engaged in; they are judgments based on related subjects, which people make when they encounter a proposition.

# 6.4: Specific Purpose


**Specific Purpose:** starts with one of the three general purposes and then specifies the actual topic you have chosen and the basic objective you hope to accomplish with your speech. Basically, the specific purpose answers the who, what, when, where, and why questions for your speech.

**Who**: Is going to be your audience
**What:** A basic description of the topic
**When:** What time of day is your speech going to be given
**Where:** What location is the speech being given at
**Why:** What does your audience need to hear? Why should they care?
