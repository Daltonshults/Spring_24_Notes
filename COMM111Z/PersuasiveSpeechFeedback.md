* Te effect of AI on employment unquestionably will be profound both positively and negatively. McKinsey Global Institute estimates that one-half of all activities humans are engaged in could be automated with technologies already in existence, albeit less than 5 percent can be fully automated.
* Up to 370Â million people worldwide in advanced economies, whose jobs are expected to disappear, may bring about major disruptions, albeit job losses will vary country by country.
* More time will be spent on activities whereby machines have less capability than human persons such as the management of people, application of expertise programs, and communication with other persons. Conversely, jobs requiring physical labor will likely be accomplished by machines.
