Will unlock the module a week before it is due. The week 3 module will be open at the beginning of week 2. 

### Why do parallel processing?
* You want to go faster
* You have multiple tasks that require to be finished

 Data Level Parallelism: When you have multiple datas and are performing actions on them
Task Level Parallelism: When you break the tasks up and split them among the cores


| SISD- Single Instruction Single Data         | SIMD- Single instructions multiple data      |

### Von Neuman Architecture
* Control unit
* Memory
* Arithmetic Logic Unit

Other elements:
* Clock
* Registers
* Program Counter
* Stack Pointer

**Processes**: Execute a program in memory. The process keeps a state, program counter, registers and stack

**Thread:** Shared memory, and all the context between them
* Threads can get in the way of each others memory through race conditions

When to use multithreading:
* When a program is blocked by another task
* When a certain operations can be CPU intensive
* When certain operations must respond to asynchronous I/O
* Independent behaviors and interactive simulations
* When you want to accelerate a single program on a multicore CPU chip

### Definitions
* Atomic: An operation that completes without the ability to be interrupted
* **Barrier**: The point all threads need to get to before continuing
* **Coarse-grained Parallelism**: Breaking a task up into a small number of large tasks
* **Fine-grained Parallelism**: Breaking the task into a large number of small tasks
* Deterministic: When the same input causes the same output every single time
* **Dynamic Scheduling**:
* **Reduction**: Combines the result of multiple processes to get the final answer
* **Private Variable**: When a thread has it's own variable
* **Shared Variable**: When all the threads have a shared variable, common race conditions
* **Speed Up**: $\frac{T_1}{T_N}$ 
* **Speed Up Efficiency**: $\frac{Speedup(N)}{N}$
