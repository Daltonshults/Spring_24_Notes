### 

Two types of inference:
* Elimination
	* Canceling out variables
	* Exponential time
* Enumeration
	* Exponential time

### Poly Tree
* [[Drawing 2024-05-20 08.44.15.excalidraw]]
* There is only one undirected path to get to another node
* Uses message passing
	* Propagate the probability through the tree: If you know something about A you can pass it to its neighboring nodes
* We only have the probability of something being true, and can calculate the $\neg a$ from $1-p(a)$
* Everything have a $\lambda \ \ value$ and  a $\pi \ \ value$
* $\pi \ \ message$: is a message passed from the parent to the child
* $\lambda \ \ message$: Is a message passed from child to parent
* Combine the $\lambda \ \ value$ and $\pi \ \ value$ to try to get the probability of an event
* $P\prime$ is our belief: These are variables that are happening or not happening. These are 100% or 0% 
	* We can find our information about our belief based on evidence
	* With no evidence $P  = P\prime$
		* P is always going to be the same, and $P\prime$ is P with our added evidence

### Lambda Message
* If B is a child of A,  B has k possible values, and A has two possible values. Then 
$$
\begin{align*}
m \in A \\
k \in B \\
1 \le j \le m \\\\\\\\
Lambda\ \ Message\\
\lambda_B(a_j) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} P(b_i|a_i) \lambda (b_i)

\end{align*}
$$

### π Messages
$$
\begin{align*}
B \ \ is \ \ a \ \ child \ \ of \ \ a \\
m \in A \\ 
\pi_B(a_j) = \\
	=& 1 \ \ if \ \ A \ \ is \ \ instantiated \ \ for \ \ a_j \\
	=& 0 \ \ if \ \ A \ \ is \ \ not \ \ instantiated \ \ for \ \ a_j \\
	=& \frac{P(a_j)}{\lambda_b(a_j)} \ \ else
\end{align*}
$$


### $\lambda$ Value

$$
\begin{align*}
k \in B \\
S(B) \\
\lambda(b_i) &= \\
	&= 1 \ \ if \ \ B \ \ instantiated \ \ for \ \ b_i\\
	&= 0 \ \ if \ \ B \ \ is \ \ not \ \ instantiated \ \ for \ \ b_i \\
	&= \pi_c\in S(B)\lambda_c(b_i) 
\end{align*}
$$


### π Value

$$
\begin{align*}
k \in B\\
m \in a\\
A \ \ is \ \ the \ \ present \ \ of \ \ B \\
for \ \ 1 \le i \le k\\
&= \pi(b_i) = \sum_{i=1}^m P(b_i|a_j)\pi_B(a_j)

\end{align*}
$$

### $A\prime$ Belief value

$$
\begin{align*}
K\in B\\
for \ \ 1 \le i \le k, P\prime (b_i)\\
P(b_i) = \alpha \lambda(b_i)\pi (b_i)\\
\end{align*}
$$
* $\alpha$ is a constant that normalizes the value so the sum of all the values is normalized to 1

### Steps:
1. Initialization of Network: Set $\lambda$-values and $\lambda$-messages to 1
2. $A$ has $m$ values for, for $1\le j \le m$ 
	* Set $P\prime (a_j) = P(a_j$)
	* set $\pi(a_j)=P(a_j)$
3. $\forall \  \ B \in S(A)$, compute the π-message for B 


### Update Rules
* If we get a lambda message, and we are not instantiated. You need to compute the new lambda value of B


* Initialize the network to compute the prior probabilities (i.e.,the probabilities based on the instantiation of no variables) of  all variables as follows:  
	1. Set all λ-messages and λ-values to 1.  
	2. If the root A has m possible values, then for 1 ≤ j ≤ m, set  P′($a_j$ ) = P($a_j$ ), and set π($a_j$ ) = P($a_j$ ).  
	3. For all children B of the root A, compute a new π-message for  
	4. using operative formula 2.  
	5. For all children B of the root A, post a new π-message to B  using Update Rule C.  
* A propagation flow will then begin due to updating in Step D.  
* Note that Step B was not in the original algorithm, but seems  necessary.

Update Rules:
When a variable is instantiated or λ- or π-messages are received by  
a variable, use one of the following updating procedures.

**Rule A**
If a variable B is instantiated for bj , then  
1. Set P′(bj ) = 1 and for i ̸ = j, set P′(bi ) = 0.  
2. Compute λ(B) using operative formula 3.  
3. Compute new λ-messages for B’s parent using operative formula 1.  
4. Post the new λ-messages to B’s parent using Update Rule B.  
5. Compute new π-messages for B’s children using operative formula 2.  
6. Post the new π-messages to B’s children using Update Rule C.

**Rule B**
If a variable B receives a new λ-message from one of its children and if B is not already instantiated, then  
1. Compute the new value of λ(B) using operative formula 3.  
2. Compute the new value of P′(B) using operative formula 5.  
3. Compute new λ-messages for B’s parent using operative formula 1.  
4. Post the new λ-messages to B’s parent using Update Rule B.  
5. Compute new π-messages for B’s children using operative formula 2.  
6. Post the new π-messages to B’s other children using Update  Rule C.


**Rule C**
If a variable B receives a new π-message from its parent and if B  is not already instantiated, then  
1. Compute the new value of π(B) using operative formula 4.  
2. Compute the new value of P′(B) using operative formula 5.  
3. Compute new π-messages for B’s children using operative formula 2.  
4. Post the new π-messages to B’s children using Update Rule C.
