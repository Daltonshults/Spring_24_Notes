### Current Events
* You can use other features as stand-ins for other features.
	* Education, zip-code, and single-parent were used to judge recidivism rates, and those "features" can be a stand-in for a race or other feature you can search for. Basically any data that is correlated to other data could be used to do this.
	* Example of reducing this skew: Combining education level and comparing it relatively to their peers within a certain area. This could reduce the bias, but you would have to dig down into the data to see if there is a correlation

### NIM
* Reduce the number of tokens to x % 3 = 1
* Whomever starts at 9 can reduce it to 7, 7%3=1
	* If the number we start with is not x%3=1 we can remove a certain amount of tokens to play optimally. Whomever, goes first normally wins
* Example Searching Nim: [[SearchingNimAdversarialSearch.excalidraw]]
* Every scenario that we can bring it down to four we know that we can win
* Minimax Algorithm is what we are going to use for adversarial search

$$
MinimaxValue(s)=UtilityOf_{max}
$$
Utility: $\pm 1$   

$$
Utility(s) \thinspace if \thinspace s \thinspace Terminal-State
$$
$$
MAX_a \in Successors(s)\thinspace MINIMAX-VALUE(a)
$$
* If s is in a MAX state
$$
Min_n\in Successors(s) \space MINIMAX-VALUE(a)
$$
* if s is in a MIN state
	* Min is trying to maximize the worst case outcome for max, by minimizing the score
* In Situations where Min wins the utility is -1, and when MAX wins the utility is +1
* Works recursively all the way down for any game tree that is available
	* Similar to Depth-First Search

```

MINIMAX-DECISION(s): returns an action
	v <- MAX-VALUE(s)
	return n st. utility(n) = v

MAX-VALUE(s): returns utility value
	if Terminal-Test = True:
		return utility(s)
	if Terminal-Test = False:
		v <- -inf
		for(a, n)
			v <- Max(MIN-VALUE(n), v)

MIN-VALUE(s): returns a utilty value
	if Terminal-Test = True:
		return utility(s)
	if Terminal-Test = False:
		v <- inf
		for(a, n):
			v <- MIN(MAX-VALUE(n), v)
```
* Iteratively going through all of the successors, and finding the minimum value when it is "MINs" turn, and finding a maximum value when "MAXs" turn.
* Find a utility for every node in the tree. 
* Based on a depth first search
* Can be memoized
* Time Complexity: $O(b^m)$
* Space: $O(b^m)$
* Can be done with multiple players
* Pruning: Removes paths, but allows us to still have an optimal tree
	* Can prune paths that will result in the other player from winning
	* Don't have to search paths that will end up with the other player winning.
	* For Nim: Just take the path as soon as you know you can win.
	* Once a sub-tree is bound by a low number we don't want to keep looking, and memoization can be used to track if a location is not worth exploring
		* For MAX: If we are at a bound that is lower than the max utility we have so far we can stop
		* For MIN: If we are at a bound that is higher than the min utility we have so far we can stop searching
	* We have $\alpha - \beta$ pruning
		* $\alpha$ is the highest Minimax value
		* $\beta$ is the lowest Minimax value
			* `MIN-NODE=prune if v <= alpha`
			* `MIN-NODE=prune if v >= beta`
* Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithm:
	* Best case can reduce the time complexity of Minimax to $O(b^{d/2})$
		* Twice as fast: Most two players games are timed, and you have to be able to search the tree fast enough to fit in that time limit
	* Transposition: Certain moves will end up making the same subtrees, and you can use that value
		* Keep a data structure to keep track of states that you have already stored, and going between from min-> max reverse the states
* Chess has too many states to track to the end of the game
	* Can limit the depth of the search
	* Use a heuristic to get an approximate of utility
		* Not a perfect evaluator of utility
		* Return an expectation of a value
		* If we are at a terminal state return the exact number, but if we are not within that state we return the estimated utility, from the heuristic. 
		* Major is not to make it exact value of the utility, but it needs to follow the same patterns that the utility function output
			* Correlated with utility
		* Want to keep the order of the states
		* Want to compute these quickly
		* any monotonic transformation should preserve the order of the states
		* Can use evaluation functions to perform specific strategies
		* Normally are linear functions, but the issue is this assumes all of the actions are independent
			* don't have a concept of time
				* have to encode it in
		* Can do a depth-limit-test which returns an eval function, but this checks to see if you have hit a depth 
			* Pick the depth such that it takes a certain amount of physical time
			* Normally with minimax you can check the 10 plys, humans can do 5-6 plys when they are good
		* If you have a state that repeats over and over again you would then look farther than the depth limit to hopefully get yourself out of the cycle/pattern
##### HW:
Homework: New programming assignment due two weeks from now, then we are doing a Bayesian Network, and then Reinforcement Learning
* We are implementing Min-Max for Othello
* The AI Agent is playing Othello

The NIM game is affected by the number of tokens, the person who takes the last token wins. 
* Whomever is left with four tokens is going to lose.
