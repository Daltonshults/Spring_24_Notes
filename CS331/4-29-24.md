### Knowledge Base
* **Knowledge Base:** A set of sentences, and we will assume some of them are true because they are in the knowledge base
	* **Axiom:** What we assume is true
		* Assertions about the world, and can tell the knowledge base something that is true, and something is false
		* You can "ask" it a question
			* "Does Ashley like horses?" 
				* "No, Ashley does not like horses"
			* "Does Rob (I) like Patrick?"
				* "We don't know"
* **Knowledge Based Agents:**
	* Use knowledge to infer things in the domain that they are modeling
	* Needs to know everything for the problems
	* Replace everything with `p` and `q` for logical statements
	* Benefit from the most general forms of knowledge that we give it
		* This isn't the case for other agents
	* **Tell**: The agents tell us what they know
	* **Ask:** You can ask a question of the model
	* No mechanism for probability, there is no sometimes, there is only True, False, or Uncertain
	* Doesn't work in the real world, but works well in mathematical theory proving

* Example:
	* Axioms:
		* I like cats and horses
		* I like people who own cats or horses
		* Patrick has a dog
		* Kevin has a cat
		* Mathew has a horse and a cat
		* I like people who like cats and horses
		* Ashley likes cats but not horses
		* Daniel has a cat but does not like horses
	* Ask:
		* Rob likes Ashley = true
			* Not true because Rob likes people who like cats and horses
		* Rob likes Patrick = True
			* Can't tell, but it knows enough about the world that 
			* Can immediately tell you if it knows something, and if it is true or false
	* Clue: Is an example of a knowledge base
		* You build up your knowledge base as you go through the game
	* Derives a new sentence from the knowledge base
	* Adds a incoming percept into the knowledge base, and given the percept and the prior knowledge it takes an action.

### `Wumpus` World
* A 4x4 grid that represents a cave that consists of 16 rooms, can move into any room that is adjacent, but not diagonal.
* There is a thing of gold in the grid, and if you go into the room with the `Wumpus` it will eat you
* There is also a bottomless pit, and if you walk into that room you die
* give you one arrow to shoot, and the arrow will go through all the rooms until it hits the `Wumpus` or the wall
* Can only see what is in our room

**PEAS:**
* P
	* P: You get 1000 gold for getting out
	* P: -1000 points for falling into the pit
	* P: -1 pt per action
	* P: -10 for shooting the arrow
* E:
	* E: 4x4 grid 
	* E: Player starts in (1, 1)
	* E: Agent starts facing right
	* E: 20% of the rooms are going to be a pit
	* E: `Wumpus` can be in any room besides the first one
		* Does not move, cannot walk into its room
* Actions:
	* Forward 
	* Left (90*)
	* Right (90*)
	* Grab
	* Shoot
	* Climb
* Sensors:
	* S: 5 sensors 1 bit each (0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
		* Stench: Will get a 1 in the first bit if we are within one square of the `Wumpus`
		* Breeze: Will get a 1 if we are one square away from the pit
		* Glitter: Will get 1 if we are in the room
		* Bump: Will get a 1 when we are up against a wall
		* Scream: Will get a 1 if you shoot the `Wumpus` with the arrow

**Prior Knowledge**:
* (1, 1) is safe

**Knowledge Base**:
* (1, 1) is safe

Entailment: A scenario where you slowly build up the knowledge base
* Every sentence we state must be true or false, but we don't always know the value
* Model: One possible set of assignments of true or false values for all of the variables within the environment 
	* A possible world
	* Assign a true or false, and that is how you create a model

### Algorithm
* if $\alpha$ is true in model $m$ 
	* then $m$ satisfies $\alpha$
* **Entailment:** What we use in logical reasoning to guarantee the truth of one thing if another is true
	* $\alpha \models \beta$ 
	* $(\alpha \models \beta) \not\models (\beta \models \alpha)$
	* $p \epsilon[2, 2]$
	* $\alpha = { P\epsilon [1, 2], P\epsilon [2, 2], P\epsilon [3, 1]}$
	* $B\epsilon [2, 1]$
	* $! B\epsilon [1, 1]$
	* $!B\epsilon [1, 2]$
	* $S\epsilon [1, 2]$
	* $KB \models \thinspace ! P \epsilon [1, 2]$
	* $KB \not\models P\epsilon [3, 1]$
	* $KB \models ! P \epsilon [2, 2]$
* You will AND all the rules together and if it satisfies all of the rules then it can entail information about the world
* Complexity: $O(2^n)$


**Model Checking**: 
* $i$ derives $\alpha$ from $KB$
* Sound: An inference algorithm is sound if it only derives sentences that are entailed from the knowledge base
	* If it is not sound the inferences would not be based on logic
* Complete: If it can derive any sentence that is entailed by KB
* Sound: $\forall_{\alpha \epsilon m}  KB \vdash_{\alpha} , KB \models \alpha$
* Completeness: $KB \models \alpha, KB \vdash_{i} \alpha$
