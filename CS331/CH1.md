### 1.1.1 Acting Humanly: The Turing Test Approach
**Rationality:** When a entity performs the correct actions given a specific policy.

Four Different Realms of Study in AI:
* thought vs behavior
* human vs rational
	* rational + behavior
	* rational + thought
	* human + behavior
	* human + thought


**Turing Test:** proposed by Alan Turing (1950), was designed as a thought experiment that would sidestep the philosophical vagueness of the question “Can a machine think?” A computer passes the test if a human interrogator, after posing some written questions, cannot tell whether the written responses come from a person or from a computer.
* Required Capabilities to Pass the Turing Test
	* **Natural Language Processing:** The ability to communicate successfully in a human language
	* **Knowledge Representation:** To store what it knows or hears.
	* **Automated Reasoning**: To answer questions and draw new conclusions
	* **Machine Learning:** To adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns
* **Total Turing Test**: Where the test has to be completed with a physical representation of the human that can not be differentiated from a human\
	* Requires interactions with the real world
	* Requires:
		* Computer Vision: The ability to see the environment or world.
		* **Robotics**: The ability to manipulate objects in the environment/world.

### 1.1.2 Thinking Humanly: The Cognitive Modeling Approach

**Three Ways to Thinking Humanly**:
1. **Introspection**: Trying to catch our own thoughts as they go by
2. **Psychological** Experiments: Observing a person in action
3. **Brain Imaging**: Observing the brain
