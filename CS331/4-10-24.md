### Search Algorithms
* Data structures used to implement these search algorithms
* Performance of the algorithm:
	* Completeness: Given a problem will the algorithm always find a solution if there is one
	* Optimality: If it can find a solution does the agent always find the best solution
	* Time Complexity: Can we do this in a reasonable amount of time
	* Space Complexity: Can we do it in a reasonable amount of space (memory)
* Goal Measurements (BDM):
	* Branching factor
	* Depth of the goal states: We care about the one that is the most shallow
	* Maximum length of the path in terms of the number of states

Defining Our BDM:
* Branching Factor: 5
* Depth of the goal state: 4
* Max Path Length: 7

Types of Searches:
* Uninformed Search: No extra info to our agent about the environment it is in
	* In our example: It has the map, can explore the map, and can move from node to node

**Breadth First Search:**
* Use a queue
* Start at root, and expand from the root to the 
* Complete: it will always give us a path if the branching path is finite
	* We can't have an infinite number of states
* Optimal: It will give us an optimal answer if the path costs are uniform
* Time Complexity: $b^{d+1}$ 
* Space Complexity: $

**Depth First Search:** 
* Uses a stack
* Start at root, and explore down each path one at a time until you reach a leaf node
* Complete: It will always provide a path 
* Optimal: It doesn't always construct the optimal path
* Time Complexity: $b^m$ still exponential time
* Space Complexity: Better space complexity than BFS because you explore only until you find the node


**Depth Limited First Search, and Iterative Deepening Depth First Search**:
* Starts with the depth being 1, and then you iterate until you find the correct depth for the path
* Complete: Not complete, and won't always find the path
	* Can set the depth of the search higher than the depth that the search needs to be
* Optimal: It is not optimal, but it limits the space complexity of the BFS
	* If the path costs are uniform then the 
* Time Complexity: $b^{d+1}$


**Uniform Cost Search:**
* Exactly the same as breadth first search, but it uses a priority queue rather than a queue
* The priority queue is used to prioritize edges with lower weights, this makes it so that the path is optimal
* Optimal: Yes, it will find the optimal path
* Time Complexity: $b^{c^*+1}$ Smaller than BFS and normally DFS
* Space Complexity: Higher space complexity than DFS

**Bi-Directional Search**
* Starting the search from the root node, and goal node. These should eventually meet in the middle
* Time Complexity: $b^{\frac{d}{2}}$

**Informed Searches**

**Best First Search:**
* Take the straight line distance between the vertices. Used as a heuristic for informed searches
* Greedy Approach: We are taking the "best" current option
* Data Structure: Priority Queue
* Only cares about the weight of the heuristic
* Optimal: Not optimal, can find a path with more steps the the depth
* Complete: Will work if there is no infinite paths
* Time Complexity: $b^{m}$ (same as DFS)
* Space Complexity: $b^m$
* Problems: It will run into dead ends, but sometimes end near the goal state, but does not have a path to the goal state
* Using a heuristic function!!!

**A Star Search**
* Uses a heuristic, and the path cost to find the goal state
* Optimal: A Star is an optimal search if the heuristic is admissible
* Straight Line distance is admissible because it cannot overestimate the distance between the points
* **Admissible**: A heuristic that will never overestimate the difference 
* Data Structure: Priority queue that is sorted on the cost of the heuristic, and path cost 
	* $f(n)=h(n)+p(n)$
* Time Complexity: $b^d$
* Space Complexity: $b^d$
* The weight is the weight of the entire path from the root node to the current node

**Consistency in Heuristics:** A heuristic is consistent if it completes the triangle of equality
* For a path $n$ that is from $n$ to the $n_{goal}$ is always greater than or equal from going from the state $n\prime$
* Every consistent heuristic is admissible, but not all admissible heuristics satisfy this, but most of them do
