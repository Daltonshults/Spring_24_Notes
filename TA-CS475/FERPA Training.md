**FERPA** stands for the **Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act**. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974 (Public Law 93-380), as amended, Oregon Revised Statutes 351.065, and their implementing regulations, afford students certain rights with respect to their educational records and require Oregon State University to assure that those students' rights are not abridged. FERPA is a federal act, meaning that all institutions that received federal funding must abide by FERPA.
* Don't release records without consulting the FERPA guidelines
	* General idea is NO DON'T GIVE OUT THE RECORDS

FERPA also applies to
- organizations doing research for, or on behalf of, the institution
- members of OSU's institutional governing board
- accreditation agency representatives
- scholarship committee members

Legitimate Educational Interest:
- relates to a student's education or discipline, or
- provides an academic service or benefit to a student.
- NEED
	- An example of a legitimate educational interest would be an academic advisor who needs to review a student's education record to determine what courses have been and/or need to be completed.  This is a task related to advising the student.  The advisor would not be authorized to view education records that are not relevant to the task at hand.
- NOT NEEDED
	- An example of an employee who does not have an educational need to know would be a physical trainer at Dixon. While the trainer is providing a service to the student, that service is not directly related to a student's academic record.


**Examples of education records include:**  
- Admissions information for students who are accepted and enrolled;
- Biographical information including date and place of birth, gender, nationality, information about race and ethnicity, and identification photographs;
- Grades, test scores, evaluations, courses taken, and official communications regarding a student's status;
- Course work including papers and exams, class schedules, as well as written, email or recorded communications;
- Disciplinary records;
- Students' financial and financial aid records;
- Internship program records.
- Employment records related to a student's employment in a position for which only students are eligible.

**What is NOT considered an educational record?**
- A note/reminder about a student, written only for yourself and to which no one else has access
- OSU police records, as long as they weren’t derived from other OSU student record databases
- A peer-graded paper for a student before being collected and graded by an instructor
- Alumni association records, as long as they weren’t derived from other OSU student record databases

**What are students' rights under FERPA?**
FERPA protects four specific rights of students. The right to:
 
**Inspect**  
Students have the right to inspect and review their education records in a timely manner. Specifically, students have the right to inspect their records within 45 days of their request.

**Amend**  
Students have the right to request the amendment of their education records that they believe are inaccurate or misleading.  
  
  
**Consent**  
Students have the right to consent to disclosures of the personally identifiable information contained in their educational records.  
 

**Complain**  
Students have the right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by Oregon State University to comply with the requirements of FERPA.



**Student education records may not be disclosed to anyone unless**  
- the student has given written consent, or
- the request fits one of the legal exceptions.

**Directory Information**
- student’s name
- current mailing address and telephone number
- current OSU ONID email address
- campus office address
- student's home city, county, state, country
- class standing (e.g. freshman, sophomore, etc.)
- student level (undergraduate, graduate, etc.)
- college
- major field of study
- honors
- full-time or part-time enrollment status
- status as a graduate teaching assistant or graduate research assistant and hours of service.
- participation in officially recognized activities and sports
- dates of attendance
- anticipated graduation date
- degrees and awards received
- date(s) of degree(s)
- most recent previous educational institution attended by student

**Confidentiality Rights**:
Students have the right to establish a confidentiality restriction on the release of their records **including directory information**. Before releasing directory information, you must check to see if the student has the “Confidential” restriction in place . You may not release any information about a student who has established confidentiality of their records - you cannot even acknowledge that the student is or ever was registered at OSU.

**How to access confidentiality status**
- In Banner, any form that lists student-specific information will give a warning message when the Student ID is typed in, and then the word “Confidential” will appear in the upper left corner of the form.
- In Canvas, Self-Service Banner, or Beaver Hub, the word “confidential” will display near the student's name.
- In data reporting systems, you must include the Confidential flag as a column in your query; anyone with a “Y” in that column is a confidential student.

**Requirements of Consent**
- the precise information to be disclosed,
- the purpose of the disclosure,
- to whom the disclosure may be made
- the expiration date of the consent (a maximum of one year)
- the student's signature and date of signing
- Must be from an ONID Email

**Directory Information**: Releasable unless the student has put a hold on it

**Non-Directory Information**: Is any information about a student that is not in the list of OSU directory information. 

**Students Don't Have the Right to See**:
- confidential letters of recommendation (those to which the student has waived access in writing),
- financial information of their parents,
- those items not defined as education records, or
- records that contain information on more than one student, in which case the student may see only those portions of the record that pertain to her or himself.

**FERPA Exceptions:**
* Subpoenas
* Inquiry under the USA Patriot Act

**When Encountering an Exception**: CONTACT THE REGISTRAR'S OFFICE

**Parents need written consent from their child to get access to their academic records**
* THIS IS AN OREGON LAW THAT PREVENTS THIS
* **You may release student information to parents only with the written consent of the student** – regardless of the student's age, or whether the student is a legal dependent of the parent, or whether the parent pays the student's tuition and school expenses.


**FERPA VIOLATIONS**:
* If you accidentally violate the confidentiality of a student contact the Registrar's Office IMMEDIATELY. 
	* (541)-737-4048
* Repeated, or negligent violations will result in disciplinary action
	* Can lose the school federal funding
