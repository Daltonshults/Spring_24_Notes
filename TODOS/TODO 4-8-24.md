	* Generate production secret key
	* Generate production JWT salt
* Figure out allowed hosts 
* Configure workouts to delete after 30 days if they are not favorited

	* Have to pass to front end so they can be displayed chronologically
* Make `difficulty` class into `Difficulty`
* Add workout description to `active_workout` view

	* So, that when the user clicks a heart ❤️ it can add it to the database
* Paginate workouts, and songs
* Handle MP3/MP4
* Update search to handle multiple filters
* Figure out DNS and domain name
* How to handle SSL with Django
* Remove `FavoriteWorkoutPlaylist`
* Workout the Groups and` PermissionMixins`
* Figure out `Token`
* Adjust `select_music` endpoint to deal with new flow
*  Adjust generating data script to handle new `workoutplaylist` model (4/11)
* Logistics of how people are using it on the phone
# FIX HOME REDIRECT WITH AUTH √
# FIX THE REFRESH TOKEN TO HANDLE EXPIRATION

Logistical Challenge:
