### Volumes
* **Use**: Used for persisting data. You can have a database with persistent data by using a volume.
* Get a list of Volumes by using `docker volume ls`
* Create a volume: `docker volume create <volume-name>`
```bash
docker volume create <volumep-name>

docker run \
	--mount 'type=volume,src=new_volume,dst=/test'\
	-it --rm alpine bash
```

### Bind Mounts
* Used to mount a local directory to a container
* Mounted docker files are the same files that are in and outside of the container
```bash
docker run --mount "type=bind,source=${pwd}/app,target=/app" -it --rm apline sh 
# Used ${pwd} to create the full path
```

### Docker Compose
* A way of running multiple docker containers together at once
* Put together one file
	* Launch with `docker compose up`
	* Shutdown with `docker compose down`

```yaml
services:
	bunker:
		build:

		ports:
			- "1234:1234"
		volumes:
			- bunker_home:/home/usere # Volume
			- ~/osucirriculum:/home/user/osucurriculum # Bind FULL PATH
		
		stdon_open: true
		tty: true

		environment: - TERM=xterm-456color
volumes:
	bunker_home: {} # Creates a default volume if they don't exist
```
* `--service-ports` allows you to expose and forward information through ports
* When using a Docker compose file, and you have a bunch of services. If one of the containers relies on the other container, Docker compose has a way of checking if something else is launched first.
	* In the case of a database, the container can be running and the database might not be ready.
	* App tries to connect to the database, and if the database is not available it will retry until the database is available
