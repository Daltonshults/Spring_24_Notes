### A note of `PUT` and `GET`
* `PUT` creates or updates a record
* `POST` Creates a record

* `PUT /records/{id}`
	* Should be the opposite of `GET`
	* `GET` should be able to get a particular record, and `PUT` adds to the record
	* `PUT` will always have an ID
	* What if the ID doesn't exist?
		* Create it if you want to create it or it makes sense to create it
	* 
### Choosing End Points Based On a Description

"Need to be able to access GIS data. Need to be able to add points with the name/lat/lon. Also, need to be able to add "ways", which are ordered collections of points. And "areas" which are closed-loop ways. Need to be able to query for these items, also filtering by name or lat/lon bounding box."

Find the nouns:
* GET /points
* GET /ways
* GET/ areas
* GET /points?bbox=x,y,z,w
* GET /points
```json
[
	{
		"id": [number],
		"name": [string],
		"lat": [number],
		"lon": [number],
		"ele": [number]
	}
]
```
* GET /ways
```json
[
	pointid,
	pointid,
	pointid,
	pointid,
	pointid
]
```

* PUT /add/{string: name}/{string: lat}{string: lon}

Think about what the front-end developers are going to want, and try to build it how you think they would want it. Think about what the "user" is going to want at the end of the day.
### Demo: ExpressJS Hello World
```javascript
var express = require("express");
  
var app = express();
  
var port = 8086;

function on_ready() {
console.log("Server ready");
}
// Start listening on the above port for connections
app.listen(port, on_ready); // Second argument is a call back function
```

```javascript
// More JS style syntax
var express = require("express");

var app = express();  

var port = 8086;

// Start listening on the above port for connections
app.listen(port, () => {
console.log("Server ready");
});
// Handle certain api endpoints
```

```javascript
// Completed example
var express = require("express");

var app = express();

var port = 8086;

// Start listening on the above port for connections
app.listen(port, () => {
console.log("Server ready");
});

// Handle certain api endpoints
app.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
res.status(200);
res.send("Hello world!\n");
}); // app.get's second arg is a callback function

// Handle certain api endpoints
app.get("/foo", (req, res, next) => {
res.status(200);
res.send("I pity the foo!!\n");
}); // app.get's second arg is a callback function
```
