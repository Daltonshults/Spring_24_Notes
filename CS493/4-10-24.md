### In-Class Challenge: Add DELETE to Message Board
* Solutions:
	* Make an object, and delete the object
	* Marking it as deleted
		* Don't actually have to delete the data, and this allows you to see messages that have been deleted, or in other words we can track the messages that have been deleted

How to deal with indexes that have been deleted?
```javascript
x = {"a": 2};

"a" in x; // == true

"b" in x; // == false
```

How to deal with pagination when dealing with objects?
* Database will solve this problem
* Can get a list of all the keys
	* Then the pagination can be done
	* Keys might not be sorted, so sorting is going to be important
		* O(n)
### Get Docker Running

**Image:** An image is used to launch a container
* Can make your own images
* Example: We were currently running the alpine image
	* Can create a specific image to act a specific way

**Container**: The container that is the application actually running
* Created from images, but are actively run

Benefit: AWS offers container services where you can launch your own container, and that is run on the AWS servers.
