### Course Overview
* Writing back-ends
* RESTful APIs
* Docker
* Databases, SQL, key-value pairs
* Authentication
* Scaling
* Work offline
### This Week
* Start a 4-part project
	* 3 week project
	* Put together a web server that sends back data back to the client
* INSTALL NODE.JS
* Install Docker Desktop
### RESTful APIs
* What is a RESTful API?
* GET - the request you make to get information from the server
* CRUD- operations are represented in the HTTP request methods
	* GET (READ)
	* POST (CREATE)
	* PUT (CREATE/UPDATE)
	* PATCH (PARTIAL UPDATE)
	* DELETE (DELETE)
* You can use `curl` to create requests from the command line
### Using HTTP Methods

* API for monitoring field moisture
	* GET /fields - get a list of all fields and information
		* Response: 
		```json
			{
				fields: [
					{FIELD_DATA},
					{FIELD_DATA}
				]
			}
		```
		* GET /fields/{id} -- get information on a specific field
		```json
		{FIELD_DATA}
		```
		* GET /fields/{id}/owner -- get ownership information for a specific field
		* POST /fields -- creates a new field record
			* Request: 
			```JSON
			{FIELD_DATA}
			```
			* Response:
			```json
			{
				"id": {new_field_ID}
			}
			```
		* PUT /fields/{id} --only creates a field if it doesn't exist yet
		* DELETE /fields/{id} -- deletes objects by ID
		* 

### In Class Challenge Small API
* An API to access a UFO sighting database. We want to be able to add new sightings, change a sighting status to things like "suspected", "confirmed", or "hoax," delete sightings, and list sightings. We should be able to just the by "zip code" or "lat/lon" and or date


Endpoints:
* GET /sightings 
	* Returns a list of sightings
* POST /sighting - Used for creating a new sighting
	* Request: 
	```json
	{
		"status": (0-2),
		"lat": {float},
		"long": {float},
		"zip": {int}
	}
	```
	* Response:
	```json
	{
		"id": {int}
	}
	```
* PUT /sighting/{int: sighting ID}- Used to update a sighting 
	```json
	{
		"id": {int: sighting_id}
		"status": (0-2),
		"lat": {float},
		"long": {float},
		"zip": {int}
	}
		```
* GET /sightings/new - gets all the "recent" sightings or whatever time frame we want recent to be
* GET /sightings/{int: start time}/{int: end time} - gets all sightings between start and end time
* DELETE /sightings/{int: sighting ID} - deletes a sighting from the database
