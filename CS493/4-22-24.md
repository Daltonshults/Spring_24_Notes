### Weekly Project: Add a Database
* There will be a skeleton project and you can build off of that
* We are going to use a docker container to run the database and we will expose the ports to access it
* Setup:
	* Running in a docker container isolates it from everything else
		* One way to get into the container is through a port
	* What if you have multiple containers running, and you want them to cooperate
		* What network are they on?
			* You have to create a container network
* We are going to have to handle the asynchronous database calls within our api

### Docker

```Docker Command Line
# Create the network and set the type
docker network create --driver bridge <Name>

# Run the server
docker run -d --name mysql-server --network mysql-net \
	-p 3306:3306 \
	-e "MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=yes" \ # makes a random root user
	-e "MYSQL_DATABASE=bookaplace" \
	-e "MYSQL_USER=bookaplace" \
	-e "MYSQL_PASSWORD=some_safe_password" \
	mysql # Name of the image that we want to use
	
```


```
# Finds the password set in the Docker container
docker logs mysql-server 2>&1 | grep PASSWORD

# Run the docker container
docker run -d --name mysql-server --network mysql-net sa
```


### JavaScript Promises (Futures in Flutter)
* We are going to do some work, and we promise to get it back to you

Old classic way of doing it 
```Js
// Anon function
do_something(() => {
	console.log("done!");
});

// Callback Hell: the problem is demonstrated below 
do_something(() => {
	do_something_else(() => {
		do_something_else_else(() => {
		
		});
	});
});

// This was one of the solutions
do_something()
	.then(do_something_else)
	.then(do_something_else_else)
// Do something returns a promise, and the .then() method is called immediately but it only appends something to the event queue

// They replaced the .then() with async and await
async function foo() {
	await do_something();
	await do_something_else();
	await do_something_else_else();
}
```

* Can only `.then()` a function that returns a promise.
* `async` and `await` allow us to think about the program in a synchronous way
* Our database requests are going to be a promise, and we can use `async` and `await` to manage this
* If you call await you have to async the function

```js
async function getLodgingsCount() {
const [ results ] = await mysqlPool.query(
		"SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM lodgings;"
	);

	return results[0].count;
}
```
