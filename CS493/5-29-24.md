### RabbitMQ and Queueing Overview
* Knowing how the data flows through a program is a valuable skill because it allows you to break the project down into smaller pieces.
### Producers and Consumers
Our queue is available from many systems.

Protocol AMPQ implemented by RabbitMQ:
1. Connect to the server
2. Create a channel
3. Connect (or create) a queue on the server


**Connect to the Server**
```js
// Require ampq
const ampq = require('ampq');

connection = ampq.connect(...)
```
**Create a Channel**:
```js
channel = connection.createChannel();
```
**Create or connect to queue:**
```js
// Does not return a queue
channel.assertQueue('queueName');
```
**Send Data to Queue, producer**
```js
channel.sendToQueue('queueName', Buffer.from(data));
```
**Receive data from the queue, consumer**
```js
channel.consume('queueName', (msg) => {
	// Do something
	// msg is a buffer or something that contains a buffer
	// Stringify the content
	s = msg.content.toString();
	// JSONify the content: turns it into an object.
	j = msg.content.toJSON();

	// If it is an image: How to extract the image data
});
```
* Chunk these things into your head:
	* You have some system that has two big operations on it
		* How to connect to it
		* Need to add and remove from the queue
Managing Images:
* Saving the image into the database gives us a reference to the image in the db. Then you can use the ID of the image to get the image back out of the database.
* Store the id into the AMPQ

### Architecture
* Producer:
	* Connect to RabbitMQ
	* Receive an image from the POST /image endpoint
	* Add the image ID to the queue to get a thumbnail processed
* Consumer:
	* Another program!
	* Connect to RabbitMQ
	* Receive request from the queue
	* Get the image from the database
	* Generate the thumbnail image
	* Add thumbnail to the DB

Don't forget `channel.ack(msg);`
