### Docker
* Images: Used to instantiate containers. Kind of like a class is to an instantiated object.
	* We will be turning in an image of our application and we can connect to it from our local browser
	* Have to build the image which is a definition that includes the application
	* Making an image of a linux system could be a lot
		* someone has already done all of this
		* Take someone else's image of a Linux system, and attach what we need to it
			* In this class it will be a Image with Node already contained within it.
* Containers
### DockerFiles
* **DockerFile**: Describes what the image should look like


```dockerfile
FROM node
WORKDIR /usr/app
COPY package*.json . 
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```
Tips: Know what directory inside the image you are in, and what directory you are inside the image.
* `WORKDIR /usr/app` moves into and creates a directory that we want, but does not copy what we need
* `COPY package*.json` will copy all of the matching files into the current working image directory
* `RUN npm install` installs everything in the package.json file
* `COPY . .`: copies all of the files from the current working directory on the machine into the current working directory of the docker container
	* Don't want to copy `Node.Modules` because there might be an updated version
* `EXPOSE <port number>` is used to expose the port number that the server is listening on
* Can create a docker ignore file to have docker ignore certain files when I am creating the image.

```.dockerignore
node_modules
npm-debug.log
.git
```
* Command for building a docker file
	* `docker build -t my-app-image .`
		* The . is showing the directory that the docker should be in
	* Can build with a specific port mapping
		* `docker run -it -p 3000:3000 my-app-image`
### Publishing ports


Next Class: Docker Compose, Volumes, bind points
* Docker compose allows you to use one config file to launch all of the docker containers that are needed to run a program.
