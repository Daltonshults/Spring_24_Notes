**Labeling of tasks:** Epic->Feature->User Story->Task

### Scrum
* Prioritize backlog
* Have a time frame: the length of your sprint
* Need a velocity and capacity
* Estimates of how long it is going to take for work to be completed.
### Kanban
* Prioritized list of work, that can be done within a specific time frame.
* Call centers are Kanban styles of agile
	* They get through the call list

### Story Points:
* A measure of a size of work that will be delivered in a certain time period.
* Key points of story points:
	* Complexity
	* Level of Effort
	* Risk
		* What can go wrong
		* How does it affect other peoples code
		* How many other items is this going to affect
* Use a Fibonacci sequence 
	* where n is the number of things you are trying to deliver and n+1 is the number of weeks it will take.
*  1 Point would be about half a day of work


### Scaling Agile
* Scaled Agile
	* Improved alignment with organizational agility
		* Bringing teams to have a common plan of delivery
		* Organizes chaos
	* Accelerate time to market
		* Get the product to customers faster
	* Deliberate control of prioritized work to deliver for an organization
		* ]Allow for planned market announcements
		* Team(s) work on common feature or function within a known timeframe
	* Must have organized teams operating in similar fashion-mostly scrum
	* Can't scale crazy:
		* The teams need to have a common language:
			* Same terminology
		* Scrum team must be focused in order to scale
### Commonality across teams:
* Planning:
	* As teams operate in a similar fashion, it enables management to plan based upon the past
	* Knowing the velocity of teams helps us determine the capacity for future objectives
* Confidence in Delivery:
	* There is less confidence of delivery the future in the future we project
	* Plans can and will change by that time

### Workflows and Hierarchy of work Items:
* Four Tiered System
	* Management:
		* Portfolio: This is where all the work funnels ini from
			* Can take a quarter of a year to multiple years to deliver
			* Everything has to come in this way, and it is crucial to getting agile running because this is how the tasks are organized.
		* Initiative: 
	* Teams:
		* Project Epic:
			* Story
			* Spike
			* Bug


**Project Workflow:**
* Icebox
	* Highest priority items are a list of 1-N items
* Ready for Dev
* Development
* Ready for QA
* In QA Resolved
* Closed

### How does planning work?
* Soln requests
* Portfolio: that is being groomed and how they are going to be delivered
* Portfolio management: When and how are we going to do this?
* Asset Reqs: Each asset has a requirement
* Product Owners: organize the asset requirements and plan how they are going to be done
* Capacity Allocation: 60/40 split:
	* 60 is from the portfolio, and 40% is the requirements from the product owners
	* Then they are placed into a sprint

**Project Workflow Planning:**
* Icebox
	* Highest priority items are a list of 1-N items
* **Review**
* Analysis
* Backlog
* Implementing
* Closed
